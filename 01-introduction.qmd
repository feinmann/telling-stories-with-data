## 01-Introduction

> And finally, for writing, it would be best to turn inward. Force

> and again. You will get better. That said, there are some useful books,

This quote stems from the excellent book `Telling Stories with Data` by @Alexander2023 . So far, I was only reading the preface and the last chapter, where I found this advice of how to improve ones writing. So, this brings me to writing this very text. I am planning to write something about myself the coming days and hope to

1.  improve my writing
2.  order my thoughts
3.  learn something new

And as I am not a native English speaker, I hope to improve my English writing, but also my writing in general (also my German one).
